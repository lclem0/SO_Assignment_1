This report presents a comprehensive analysis of two simulation-based projects. The first part consists of simulating an inventory system to evaluate the effectiveness of different
inventory policies. The second part of the assignment focuses on the implementation of the SIR model using both the
Forward Euler and Runge-Kutta 4th order methods to simulate the spread of an infectious disease within a population. Key performance metrics and comparative analysis are provided for
both tasks, highlighting the cost-effectiveness and accuracy of the simulated models.

This assignment was developed for the first project of Simulation and Optimization in may 2024 in Aveiro University, Portugal.
